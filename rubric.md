| **Shape Interface Design**        | 1.0       | Abstract `Shape` interface is correctly defined with pure virtual methods (`setPosition`, `setColor`, `getDrawable`) that enforce a clear abstraction. No implementation details leak into the interface, fully adhering to DIP. | `Shape` interface is defined with virtual methods, but minor issues exist (e.g., unclear naming or an extra non-virtual method). Still functional and mostly aligns with DIP. | `Shape` interface is defined but flawed (e.g., missing a required method like `getDrawable` or not fully abstract). Partially violates DIP by depending on some details. | No `Shape` interface defined, or it’s concrete with implementation details (e.g., directly uses `sf::CircleShape`), completely violating DIP. |
| **Concrete Shape Implementation** | 1.0       | At least one concrete class (e.g., `Circle`) fully implements the `Shape` interface. Methods like `setPosition`, `setColor`, and `getDrawable` are correctly implemented, with proper encapsulation of `sf::Shape` details. | Concrete class (e.g., `Circle`) implements the `Shape` interface, but with minor issues (e.g., incomplete encapsulation or slight deviation in method behavior). Still usable. | Concrete class exists but has significant issues (e.g., missing a method implementation or directly exposing `sf::Shape` details), weakening the abstraction. | No concrete class implemented, or it doesn’t inherit from `Shape` and directly uses `sf::CircleShape` without abstraction. |
| **Game Class Refactoring**        | 1.0       | `Game` class is fully refactored to depend only on the `Shape` abstraction (uses `Shape*`). Can work with any `Shape` implementation (e.g., `Circle` or `Square`) without modification, perfectly adhering to DIP. Threre is *no* dependency on a concrete Shape class e.g Cirlce any where inside the Game class | `Game` class uses `Shape*` and works with the provided concrete class, but has minor coupling (e.g., assumes specific behavior like position changes). Mostly follows DIP.  Threre is *no* dependency on a concrete Shape class e.g Cirlce any where inside the Game class | `Game` class partially refactored to use `Shape*`, but still has significant coupling to a specific shape (e.g., calls `sf::CircleShape` methods directly), violating DIP. Or instansiates a CircleShape object | `Game` class unchanged, directly uses `sf::CircleShape` with no abstraction, fully violating DIP. |
